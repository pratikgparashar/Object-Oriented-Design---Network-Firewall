# Future Optimization :
 The code can be optimized to use common IP ranges for given ports to reduce space requirements. Inturn, it will speed up the processing.
 
# Further Improvements - Code Beautification:
  Given more time, I could have implemented hashcode() and equals() methods for custom classes like Port, Protocol. It could improve the readability of the code.

# External References :
 Due to given time constraint, I referred to https://gist.github.com/madan712/6651967 for finding if given IP is in allowed ranges.
  
# Test :
  Created python script to generate dummy data.
